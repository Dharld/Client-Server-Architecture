# Client-Server Application

## Project Description

The Client-Server Application is a simple project designed to demonstrate how a client (user) and a server (provider) can communicate with each other over a network. This basic setup is the foundation for many online services and applications, such as chat applications, online games, and data exchange systems.

## Features

- **Client-Server Communication**: Shows how messages can be sent between a client and a server.
- **Basic Networking**: Helps in understanding the basic principles of networking.
- **Educational Purpose**: Ideal for learning and teaching the fundamentals of networked applications.

## Contents

- **Source Code**: Includes all the necessary code to run the client and server.
  - `Client.java`: Code for the client-side application.
  - `Server.java`: Code for the server-side application.
  - `Main.java`: The main entry point for the application.
- **IDE Configuration**: Configuration files for setting up the project in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA.
  - `.idea/`: Directory containing IDE settings.
  - `ClientServer.iml`: Module file for IntelliJ IDEA.
- **Git Configuration**: Files to help manage the project with Git.
  - `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in the repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Needed to compile and run the Java code.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Optional, but IntelliJ IDEA is recommended for easier setup and development.

### How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   \`\`\`sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ClientServer.git
   cd ClientServer
   \`\`\`

2. **Compile the Source Code**:
   Navigate to the `src` directory and compile the Java files:
   \`\`\`sh
   javac Client.java Server.java Main.java
   \`\`\`

3. **Start the Server**:
   Run the `Server` class to start the server:
   \`\`\`sh
   java Server
   \`\`\`

4. **Run the Client**:
   Open a new terminal window and run the `Client` class to start the client:
   \`\`\`sh
   java Client
   \`\`\`

## Project Structure

- `src/Client.java`: This file contains the code for the client-side application, which connects to the server and sends/receives messages.
- `src/Server.java`: This file contains the code for the server-side application, which listens for connections from clients and processes their messages.
- `src/Main.java`: This file contains the main method to start the application.

## Notes

- Make sure the server is running before starting the client to avoid connection errors.
- Modify the server and client IP addresses and ports as needed for your specific network setup.
